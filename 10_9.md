Consider the following invocation of the `fstatcheck` would fetch and display metadata for the file `foo.txt`.

```c
if (Fork() == 0) { /* child */
    /* What code is the shell executing right here? */
    Execve("fstatcheck", argv, envp);
}
```

## Answer

```c
if (Fork() == 0) {  /* child */
  int foo = open("foo.txt", O_RDONLY, 0);
  dup2(foo, STDIN_FILENO);
  execve("fstatcheck", argv, envp);
}
```

Consider the following invocation of the `fstatcheck` would fetch and display metadata for the file `foo.txt`. However, when we run it on our system, it fails with a "bad file descriptor." Given this behavior, fill in the pseudocode that the shell must be executing between fork and execve calls:

```c
if (Fork() == 0) { /* child */
    /* What code is the shell executing right here? */
    Execve("fstatcheck", argv, envp);
}
```

## Answer

```c
if (Fork() == 0) {  /* child */
  int foo = open("foo.txt", O_RDONLY, 0);
  dup2(foo, STDIN_FILENO);
  execve("fstatcheck", argv, envp);
}
```
